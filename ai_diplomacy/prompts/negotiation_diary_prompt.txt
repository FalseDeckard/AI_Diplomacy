TASK
You have not yet negotiated this phase. Prepare your negotiation intent before sending new messages. Focus on upcoming objectives, leverage, and deception plans rather than post-hoc outcomes. Do not provide detailed tactical justification for specific orders here; reserve that for the Order Diary.

1. SITUATION REVIEW: Outstanding promises, betrayals, or commitments from prior phases that shape negotiations now.
2. NEGOTIATION OBJECTIVES: Concrete results you aim to secure in the upcoming talks (supports, DMZs, swaps, timing).
3. TARGETED OUTREACH: Which powers you will engage, avoid, or pressure; tone and rationale for each outreach.
4. LEVERAGE AND PRESSURE: Assets, information, or threats you will use; concessions you are willing or unwilling to grant.
5. RELATIONSHIP UPDATES: Adjust trust levels based on recent behavior and how that affects your approach.
6. NEGOTIATION AGENDA: Key talking points, offers, and red lines you intend to present (a forward-looking plan, not a recap).
7. OWN DECEPTION INTENT: Whether you plan to deceive/betray/lie this phase, whom you will target, why, and any constraints or limits.

When powers ignore your messages, plan how to address it:
- Are they avoiding commitment because they are planning betrayal?
- Do they have better offers from other powers?
- Should you pressure them, offer better terms, or deprioritize them?
- What does their silence reveal about their strategic priorities and how will you surface a response?
