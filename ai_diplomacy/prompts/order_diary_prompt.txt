TASK
Before submitting orders, finalize your tactical and diplomatic plan. Think through how you will employ deception, who will be misled, what promises you will keep or break, and why. This is pre-action reasoningâ€”no post-hoc justification. Do not mention "final" orders have been sent yet; you are still planning.

1. TACTICAL PLAN: How you intend to use your units this phase; key objectives, sequencing, and contingencies.
2. OPPONENT PREDICTIONS: Likely moves/reactions from each relevant power and how they affect your plan.
3. DECEPTION PLAN (OTHERS): Lies, betrayals, or misdirection you will deploy; targets, stories, and trigger conditions.
4. COORDINATION & PROMISES: Agreements you will honor or break; new offers/supports you will request or fabricate.
5. RISK WATCHLIST: Failure modes (diplomatic or tactical) to monitor and the telltale signs that force adaptation.
6. VERIFICATION PLAN: Specific tests or signals (supports, bounces, timed confirmations) to validate others' claims.
7. INTENDED ORDERS: List the orders you plan to submit (they are not executed yet); include any alternates if contingent on negotiations.

When powers ignore you or hedge, plan how to surface a response:
- Escalate pressure, sweeten the offer, or deprioritize the relationship?
- What leverage or information will you use?
- How will silence affect your trust and deception plan?
