TASK
Write a detailed private diary entry reflecting on your issued orders. Focus on concrete reasoning tied to these orders and actionable checks for next phase. Avoid repeating high-level negotiation summaries; only include deltas since the last negotiation diary.

1. TACTICAL REASONING (CONCRETE): Why these specific orders now? What immediate threats/opportunities do they address? What key assumptions underpin them?
2. RISK ASSESSMENT: What could go wrong with these orders? List concrete failure modes and your contingencies.
3. OPPONENT PREDICTIONS: Expected orders/reactions by other powers tied to these orders; signals that would confirm/deny.
4. NEXT-PHASE POSTURE (DELTA): How these orders change your posture for the next phase; opportunities opened/closed (avoid long-horizon repetition).
5. DECEPTION & COORDINATION (OTHERS): Who might be deceiving you and why; evidence and confidence; tests (costly signals, verifiable exchanges) you will use next phase.
6. SELF-DECEPTION & YOUR OWN DECEPTION (CRITICAL): Be explicit about your own misinformation tactics and blind spots:
	• Promises you made (to whom, exact content, phase) and whether you intend to keep, delay, break them or do something else(with rationale).
	• Cover stories / omissions you’re using, what could expose them, and your recovery plan if caught.
	• Assumptions most likely to be wrong and the disconfirming evidence you’ll watch for.
