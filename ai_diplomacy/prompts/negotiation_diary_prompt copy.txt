TASK
Write a detailed diary entry analyzing the negotiations and planning your strategy. Include:

1. DETAILED THOUGHTS: Your honest assessment of each power's motivations, trustworthiness, and likely actions
2. STRATEGIC PLANS: Specific tactical plans for the next 2-3 phases, including contingencies
3. DECEPTION ANALYSIS: Who might be lying to you? What are their likely hidden agendas?
4. FUTURE POSITIONING: Where do you want to be in 3-4 phases? What alliances do you need?
5. RELATIONSHIP UPDATES: Based on behavior, update your trust levels with each power
6. NEGOTIATION OUTCOMES: Summarize key agreements and your confidence in them

When powers ignore your messages, analyze:
- Are they avoiding commitment because they're planning betrayal?
- Do they have better offers from other powers?
- Should you pressure them, offer better terms, or write them off?
- What does their silence reveal about their strategic priorities?

EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1: As France, after discussing a joint move against Germany with England, while Italy seems to be posturing aggressively in Piedmont.

{
"private_thoughts": "England seems genuinely interested in cooperation against Germany, but I need to watch for signs they're playing both sides. Their willingness to coordinate suggests they see Germany as the bigger threat right now. Italy is deeply concerning - their 'defensive' positioning in PIE is clearly aimed at keeping options open against me. The fact they won't give straight answers about their intentions tells me they're likely planning something aggressive. Russia's silence is puzzling - are they focused elsewhere or deliberately staying out of Western politics? Austria and Turkey being distracted by each other is good for me short-term.",
"strategic_plan": "Phase 1: Execute the England coordination to take RUH while holding MAR defensively. Phase 2: If successful, push deeper into Germany with English support, potentially taking MUN or BER. Need to keep one eye on Italy - if they move against MAR, immediately pivot to defensive posture and seek Austrian help against Italian expansion. Phase 3: Reassess based on Italy's actions and Russian involvement. If Italy attacks, rally Austria/England against Italian aggression.",
"deception_analysis": "Italy's vague responses about PIE being 'defensive' are almost certainly lies - no one puts an army in PIE just to defend against Austria. Confidence level: 80% that Italy is planning aggression against me. England seems honest about wanting German cooperation, but I need to verify they're not also promising Germany support against me. Russia's silence could mean they're plotting something or genuinely distracted - need more information.",
"future_positioning": "Goal for 1902: Control of RUH and either MUN or BER, while maintaining MAR and possibly adding SPA if possible. Need a solid alliance with either England (against Germany/Italy) or Austria (against Italy) by 1903. Long-term, I need to prevent a German-Italian-Russian alliance that could crush me. Ideally eliminate Italy early if they prove aggressive, then focus on controlled German expansion.",
"negotiation_summary": "Reached a tentative agreement with England to support their fleet into Belgium (BEL) if they support my army into Ruhr (RUH). Italy's messages are vague but their army in Piedmont (PIE) is concerning; they claim it's defensive against Austria but it also threatens Marseilles (MAR). Russia remains silent. Austria and Turkey are focused on each other.",
"intent": "Secure Ruhr with English support. Hold Marseilles defensively. Probe Italy's intentions further. If England upholds their end, improve relations. If Italy moves on MAR, downgrade relations severely.",
"updated_relationships": {
"ENGLAND": "Friendly",
"GERMANY": "Enemy",
"ITALY": "Unfriendly",
"AUSTRIA": "Neutral",
"RUSSIA": "Neutral",
"TURKEY": "Neutral"
}
}

Scenario 2: As Turkey, after Germany proposed an alliance against Russia, but France also offered a non-aggression pact and hinted at concerns about Austria.

{
"private_thoughts": "Germany's eagerness for an anti-Russian alliance is suspicious - are they trying to drag me into a war while they focus on the West? Their offer of support into SEV is tempting but I need guarantees it's not just empty promises. France's non-aggression pact offer is interesting and aligns with my Austrian concerns, but they might just be trying to keep me out of Western affairs. The fact that France mentioned Austrian expansion suggests they see Austria as a threat too - this could be useful. Russia hasn't responded to my feelers, which could mean they're planning aggression or just focused on the north.",
"strategic_plan": "Phase 1: Secure BLA while keeping options open. Test German commitment with small coordinated move. Phase 2: If Germany proves reliable, consider joint pressure on Russia, but keep escape routes open. If Austria moves aggressively in Balkans, pivot to anti-Austrian strategy with French support. Phase 3: Establish firm control of either northern (anti-Russian) or western (anti-Austrian) expansion route based on which alliance proves more reliable.",
"deception_analysis": "Germany's enthusiasm feels forced - they might be planning to use me against Russia then abandon me when convenient. Confidence level: 60% that German support would disappear once they secure their western objectives. France's offer seems more genuine as they have less to gain from deceiving me, but they might just want me distracted from interfering in the Mediterranean. Austria's silence is concerning - they might be planning Balkan aggression while I'm distracted with Russia.",
"future_positioning": "Goal for 1902: Secure BLA and at least one additional supply center (SEV or GRE/BUL depending on alliance choice). By 1903, need to be positioned for either a Russian campaign (with solid German alliance) or Balkan defense (with French/Italian cooperation). Long-term goal: 6-7 supply centers by 1905, avoiding being the target of a major alliance.",
"negotiation_summary": "Germany is keen on an anti-Russian alliance, offering support into Sevastopol (SEV) if I attack. France proposed a mutual non-aggression pact and expressed worry about Austrian expansion in the Balkans, which aligns with my concerns. England is distant. Italy seems focused on France.",
"intent": "Prioritize securing Black Sea (BLA) and consider options against Russia, but German support needs to be concrete. Maintain neutrality with France for now, as their non-aggression pact could be useful if Austria becomes a larger threat. Try to confirm German commitment before moving on Russia. Delay any aggressive moves against Austria until my position is stronger.",
"updated_relationships": {
"GERMANY": "Friendly",
"RUSSIA": "Unfriendly",
"FRANCE": "Neutral",
"ENGLAND": "Neutral",
"ITALY": "Neutral",
"AUSTRIA": "Unfriendly"
}
}

Scenario 3: As England, when France hasn't responded to two alliance proposals and Russia is ignoring naval cooperation messages.

{
"private_thoughts": "France's silence on my alliance proposals is deeply concerning - two phases of ignoring me suggests they either have better options or see me as a threat to eliminate. Given their position, they might be coordinating with Germany or Italy against me. Russia's non-response to Baltic cooperation is similarly troubling - they might be planning northern aggression or have a French alliance. Germany's willingness to engage gives me hope, but I need to verify they're not playing multiple sides. The continental powers might be planning to box me in and eliminate my naval advantage early.",
"strategic_plan": "Phase 1: Secure English Channel and North Sea with defensive fleets while testing German reliability with Denmark coordination. Phase 2: If France remains hostile, consider aggressive moves into the Channel or Belgium to force their hand. Build armies to prepare for continental intervention. Phase 3: Based on German performance, either commit to strong German alliance with continental focus, or pivot to pure naval strategy targeting multiple powers' coastal supply centers.",
"deception_analysis": "France's silence almost certainly means they're planning aggression or have anti-English alliances. Confidence level: 85% that France sees me as an enemy. Russia's ignoring of Baltic cooperation likely means they have other naval priorities or French agreements. Germany seems honest about wanting cooperation, but I need to watch for signs they're also dealing with France behind my back. Confidence level: 40% that Germany is playing both sides.",
"future_positioning": "Goal for 1902: Control Channel, North Sea, and at least one continental supply center (BEL or NOR). By 1903, need either a strong German alliance allowing continental expansion, or dominant naval position threatening multiple powers. Long-term strategy: Prevent anti-English grand alliance while maintaining naval supremacy and gaining 6-7 centers through coastal threats and opportunistic expansion.",
"negotiation_summary": "France continues to ignore my alliance proposals regarding Belgium and the Channel, having not responded to messages in the last two phases. Russia similarly hasn't acknowledged my Baltic cooperation suggestions. Meanwhile, Germany actively engaged about Denmark. This silence from France and Russia is telling - they likely have other commitments or see me as a threat.",
"intent": "Shift focus to Germany as primary partner given their responsiveness. Prepare defensive positions against potentially hostile France. Consider more aggressive Baltic moves since Russia seems uninterested in cooperation. May need to force France's hand with direct questions or public statements.",
"updated_relationships": {
"FRANCE": "Unfriendly",
"GERMANY": "Friendly", 
"RUSSIA": "Unfriendly",
"ITALY": "Neutral",
"AUSTRIA": "Neutral",
"TURKEY": "Neutral"
